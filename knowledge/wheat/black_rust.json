  "summary": "Black rust (also called stem rust) is a fungal disease of wheat that can cause severe yield losses under favorable conditions.",
  "cause": "Caused by the fungus Puccinia graminis. It spreads via wind-borne spores and is favored by warm, humid conditions and susceptible varieties.",
  "symptoms": "Reddish-brown to black pustules on stems, leaves, and awns. Severely infected stems may weaken and lodge; infected heads can produce shriveled grain.",
  "spread": "Spores travel long distances on wind. Inoculum survives on alternate hosts and crop residues. Epidemics arise when weather favors spore germination and infection.",
  "treatment": "Remove and destroy volunteer wheat and alternate hosts where practical. Apply recommended fungicides early in the disease cycle following local guidance.",
  "prevention": "Use resistant varieties where available, rotate crops, practice good field sanitation, and monitor regional advisories to time fungicide applications."
