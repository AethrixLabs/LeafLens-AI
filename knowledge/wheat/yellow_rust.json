  "summary": "Yellow rust (stripe rust) is a damaging wheat disease that can spread quickly under cool, moist conditions.",
  "cause": "Caused by the fungus Puccinia striiformis. Favors cool temperatures (10–20°C) with moisture; spreads via wind-borne spores.",
  "symptoms": "Yellow to orange stripes or pustules along leaf veins. Severely infected plants have reduced tillering and grain filling leading to yield loss.",
  "spread": "Wind dispersal of spores enables rapid long-distance spread. Overwinters on volunteer cereals and alternative hosts in some regions.",
  "treatment": "Use registered fungicides when needed and follow integrated pest management recommendations. Timing of applications is critical for control.",
  "prevention": "Grow resistant cultivars, monitor weather and disease forecasts, remove volunteer hosts, and use crop rotation where possible."
