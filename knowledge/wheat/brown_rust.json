  "summary": "Brown rust (leaf rust) is a common fungal disease of wheat that reduces photosynthetic area and yield when severe.",
  "cause": "Caused by the fungus Puccinia triticina. It develops under warm, humid weather and spreads via wind-dispersed spores.",
  "symptoms": "Small, round to oval orange-brown pustules on leaf surfaces that release powdery spores. Infected leaves may yellow and die prematurely.",
