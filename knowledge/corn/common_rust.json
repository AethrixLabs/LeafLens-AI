{
  "disease_name": "Common rust",
  "crop": "corn",
  "symptoms": "Small, round to elongated reddish-brown pustules appear on both leaf surfaces. Pustules may darken as they age and can be surrounded by yellow halos. Heavy infections can reduce photosynthesis and weaken plants.",
  "causes": "Common rust is caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi. Spores are spread by wind and can travel long distances. Warm, humid weather favors rapid infection and spread.",
  "treatment": "Fungicides can reduce severity when applied early and according to label directions. Focus on protecting the upper leaves that contribute most to grain fill. Scout regularly to time applications effectively.",
  "prevention": "Use rust-resistant hybrids where possible. Avoid very late planting that exposes crops to peak rust pressure. Maintain good field hygiene and monitor regional rust reports.",
  "confidence_note": "The rust-like pustules match common rust, but other rust diseases can look similar in certain regions."
